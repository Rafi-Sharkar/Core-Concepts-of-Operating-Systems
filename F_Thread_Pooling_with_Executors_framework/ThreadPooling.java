// Thread Pooling means reusing a fixed number of threads instead of creating a new thread every time a task needs to run.
// A Thread Pool is a group of pre-created, reusable threads that can execute multiple tasks without being destroyed and recreated each time.

// Why thread pooling?
//      - Resource management
//      - High response time
//      - Control over thread count (provide the limitation to create threads for a process)
