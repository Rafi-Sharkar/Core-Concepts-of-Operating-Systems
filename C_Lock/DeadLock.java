package C_Lock;

// Four necessary conditions (called Coffman conditions) must exist simultaneously:
//1. Mutual exclusion --> A resource can be held by only one thread at a time.
//2. Hold and wait --> A thread holds one resource and waits for another.
//3. No preemption --> Resources cannot be forcibly taken from threads
//4. Circular wait --> A circular chain of threads exists, each waiting for the next.

// A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each otherâ€™s resources and none can proceed.
// Example:
// Thread A holds Lock 1, waiting for Lock 2
// Thread B holds Lock 2, waiting for Lock 1
